## Functions

### Function Template

```JavaScript
function functionname() {
    // code
}

functionname();
```

### For Loop Template

```JavaScript
var numberarray = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
for (var i = 0; i < numberarray.length; i++) {
    // loop 10 times
}
```

### Fibonacci Sequence

```JavaScript
function fibonacci(num){
    var a = 1, b = 0, temp;

    while (num >= 0){
        temp = a;
        a = a + b;
        b = temp;
        num--;
    }

return b;
}
```

### Fibonacci Sequence Recursion

```JavaScript
function fibonacci(num) {
    if (num <= 1){
        return 1;
    }

return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2);
}
```

## Dictionaries

### Create dictionary  

```JavaScript
var dict = {};
```

### Populate Dictionary

```JavaScript
dict["key"] = value;
// or
dict.key = "value";
```

### Iterating Key/Value Pairs

```JavaScript
for (var key in dict) {
    var value = dict[key];
}
```

### Dictionary Example

```JavaScript
var numberOfOccurences = function(array) {
    var dict = {};
    // check number of occurrences in array
    for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] in dict){
        // if the key (array value) is in dict, add
            dict[array[i]]++;
        } else {
        // if the key isn't already in dict, give it the value 1
            dict[array[i]] = 1;
        }
    }
    // display dict with key:value pairs
    console.log(dict);
    for(var key in dict){
        var value = dict[key];
        // console.log the values only
        console.log(value);
    }
};
```

| Prototype     | Allows you to add new properties/methods to object constructors. Every object in JavaScript has a hidden internal property called `Prototype` that can be used to extend object properties and methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_prototypes.asp                                                      |
| Inheritance   | inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of objects of another class. It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. Inheritance provides re usability. This means that we can add additional features to an existing class without modifying it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-guide-to-prototype-based-class-inheritance-in-javascript-84953db26df0/ |
| Classes       | A JavaScript class is a type of function. Classes are declared with the `class` keyword.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Closure       | JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope. Global variables can be made local (private) with closures. A closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-closure-b2f0d2152b36         |
| Object        | In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.<br>In real life, a car is an object. A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop. Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. The values are written as `name:value` pairs (name and value separated by a colon).<br>Objects can also have methods. Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.<br>In a function definition, `this` refers to the "owner" of the function. | https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp<br>https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp       |
| Arity         | By calling `return functionName.length;` it will return the number of arguments, which is the functions arity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4848149/get-a-functions-arity                                          |
| Hoisting      | Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp                                                               |
| Scoping       | Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.<br> Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp                                                                  |
| Callback      | We can pass a function as an argument in another function and later execute that passed-in function or even return it to be executed later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Polymorphism  | Object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects. As JavaScript is not a type-safe language, we can pass any type of data members with the methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://www.javatpoint.com/javascript-oops-polymorphism                                                    |
| Encapsulation | Enclosing all the functionalities of an object within that object so that the objectâ€™s internal workings (its methods and properties) are hidden from the rest of the application. This allows us to abstract or localize specific set of functionalities on objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Instance      | An implementation of a Function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
