# Haskell

* In purely functional programming you don't tell the computer what to do as such but rather you tell it what stuff is.  
* Statically Typed: When you compile your program, the compiler knows which piece of code is a number, which is a string and so on. That means that a lot of possible errors are caught at compile time.  
* Type Inference: You don't have to explicitly label every piece of code with a type because the type system can intelligently figure out a lot about it.
