# Haskell

* In purely functional programming you don't tell the computer what to do as such but rather you tell it what stuff is.  
* Statically Typed: When you compile your program, the compiler knows which piece of code is a number, which is a string and so on. That means that a lot of possible errors are caught at compile time.  
* Type Inference: You don't have to explicitly label every piece of code with a type because the type system can intelligently figure out a lot about it.

| Boolean items   | `&&`, `||`, `not`                                                                                                                                               |
| `succ`          | Takes anything that has a defined successor and returns that successor                                                                                          |
| `min` and `max` | The functions min and max take two things that can be put in an order (like numbers!). min returns the one that's lesser and max returns the one that's greater |
