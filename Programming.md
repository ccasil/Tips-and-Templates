## Types of Programming Languages (1)

| Type            | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Procedural      | Used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result. Typically, this type of programming language uses multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements, which separates them from functional programming languages. Functions of procedural language may control variables, other than function’s value  returns. For example, printing out information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Functional      | Uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive functions.The functional programming’s  primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects and different suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Object-Oriented | Views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external accessing parts of that data. The aim of this programming language is to think about the problem by separating it into a collection of objects that offer services which can be used to solve a specific problem. One of the main principle of object oriented programming language is encapsulation that everything an object will need must be inside of the object. This language also emphasizes reusability through inheritance and the capacity to spread current implementations without having to change a great deal of code by using polymorphism. |
| Scripting       | Often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, but they fall into their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages with support for development of large systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Logic           | Lets programmers make declarative statements and then allow the machine to reason about the consequences of those statements. In a sense, this language doesn’t tell the computer how to do something, but employing restrictions on what it must consider doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Types of Programming Languages (2)

1. Low level programming languages
   * These are machine dependent programming languages such as Binary (Machine code) and Assembly language.
   * Since computer only understand the Binary language that means instructions in the form of 0’s and 1’s (Signals - that can be either High or Low), so these programming languages are the best way to give signals (Binary Instructions) to the computer directly.
   * Machine Code (Binary Language) does not need any interpreter or compiler to convert language in any form because computer understands these signals directly.
   * But, Assembly language needs to be converted in equivalent Binary code, so that computer can understand the instructions written in Assembly. Assembler is used to convert an assembly code to its equivalent Binary code.
   * The codes written in such kind of languages are difficult to write, read, edit and understand; the programs are not portable to any other computer system.
   * Low Level programming language programs are faster than High Level programming language programs as they have less keywords, symbols and no need (less need) to convert into Machine Code.
2. High level programming languages
   * These are the machine independent programming languages, which are easy to write, read, edit and understand.
   * The languages like Java, .Net, Pascal, COBOL, C++, C, C# and other (which are very popular now to develop user end applications). These languages come under the high level programming language category.
   * High level programming languages have some special keywords, functions and class libraries by using them we can easily build a program for the computer.
   * Computer does not understand program written in such languages directly, as I have written above that computer understands only Machine code. So, here programming translators are required to convert a high level program to its equivalent Machine code.
   * Programming translators such as Compilers and Interpreters are the system software’s which converts a program written in particular programming languages to its equivalent Machine code.
   * Here are the features of High Level programming languages
       * The programs are written in High Level programming languages and are independent that means a program written on a system can be run on another system.
       * Easy to understand - Since these programming languages have keywords, functions, class libraries (which are similar to English words) we can easily understand the meaning of particular term related to that programming language.
       * Easy to code, read and edit - The programs written in High Level programming languages are easy to code, read and edit. Even we can edit programs written by other programmers easily by having little knowledge of that programming language.
       * Since, High Level language programs are slower than Low level language programs; still these programming languages are popular to develop User End Applications.
3. Middle Level programming language
   * Since, there is no such category of computer programming languages, but the programming languages that have features of low level and high level programming languages come under this category.
   * Hence, we can say that the programming languages which have features of Low Level as well as High Level programming languages known as "Middle Level" programming language.
   * C programming languages is the best example of Low Level Programming languages as it has features of low level and high level programming languages both.
