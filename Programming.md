| Procedural      | Used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result. Typically, this type of programming language uses multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements, which separates them from functional programming languages. Functions of procedural language may control variables, other than function’s value  returns. For example, printing out information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Functional      | Uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive functions.The functional programming’s  primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects and different suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Object-Oriented | Views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external accessing parts of that data. The aim of this programming language is to think about the problem by separating it into a collection of objects that offer services which can be used to solve a specific problem. One of the main principle of object oriented programming language is encapsulation that everything an object will need must be inside of the object. This language also emphasizes reusability through inheritance and the capacity to spread current implementations without having to change a great deal of code by using polymorphism. |
| Scripting       | Often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, but they fall into their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages with support for development of large systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Logic           | Lets programmers make declarative statements and then allow the machine to reason about the consequences of those statements. In a sense, this language doesn’t tell the computer how to do something, but employing restrictions on what it must consider doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
