| Symbol        | Symbol Name                   | Definition                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| A ∩ B         | intersection                  | objects that belong to set A and set B         |
| A ∪ B         | union                         | objects that belong to set A or set B          |
| A ⊆ B         | subset                        | A is a subset of B. set A is included in set B |
| A ⊂ B         | proper subset / strict subset | A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B    |
| A ⊄ B         | not subset                    | A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B    |
| A<sup>c</sup> | complement                    | all the objects that do not belong to set A    |
| a ∈ A         | element of, belongs to        | set membership                                 |
| x ∉ A         | not element of                | no set membership                              |
| \|A\|         | cardinality                   | the number of elements of set A                |

## Logic Symbols
| Symbol | Symbol Name           | Definition           |
| ------ | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| ¬      | not                   | not - negation       |
| !      | not                   | not - negation       |
| ∀      | for all               |
| ∃      | there exists          |
| ∄      | there does not exists |
| ↔      | equivalent            | if and only if (iff) |
| iff    | if and only if        |
| ∴      | therefore             |
| ∵      | because/since         |
