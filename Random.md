| Term   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Roll   | Rotation around the front-to-back axis                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Pitch  | Rotation around the side-to-side axis                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Yaw    | Rotation around the vertical axis                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Thrust | A force that moves an aircraft in the direction of the motion. It is created with a propeller, jet engine, or rocket. Air is pulled in and then pushed out in an opposite direction. One example is a household fan.                  |
| Drag   | The force that acts opposite to the direction of motion. It tends to slow an object. Drag is caused by friction and differences in air pressure. An example is putting your hand out of a moving car window and feeling it pull back. |
| Weight | The force caused by gravity. It acts in a downward directionâ€”toward the center of the Earth.                                                                                                                                          |
| Lift   | The force that holds an airplane in the air. The wings create most of the lift used by airplanes. Drag is caused by friction and differences in air pressure.                                                                         |

| Topside      | On the ship's main weather deck                                                     |
| Underdeck    | A lower deck of a ship                                                              |
