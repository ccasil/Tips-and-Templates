## Units

### Absolute Lengths

| Unit | Description                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
| cm   | centimeters                  |
| mm   | millimeters                  |
| in   | inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm) |
| px   | pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in) |
| pt   | points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)   |
| pc   | picas (1pc = 12 pt)          |

* note: Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels

### Relative Lengths

| Unit | Description                                                                               |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| em   | Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font) |
| ex   | Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)                                |
| ch   | Relative to width of the "0" (zero)                                                       |
| rem  | Relative to font-size of the root element                                                 |
| vw   | Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*                                              |
| vh   | Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*                                             |
| vmin | Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension                                           |
| vmax | Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension                                            |
| %    | Relative to the parent element                                                            |

\* Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.

## Font Size

* 1em = 12pt = 16px = 100%

1. “Ems” (em): The “em” is a scalable unit that is used in web document media. An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt. Ems are scalable in nature, so 2em would equal 24pt, .5em would equal 6pt, etc. Ems are becoming increasingly popular in web documents due to scalability and their mobile-device-friendly nature.
2. Pixels (px): Pixels are fixed-size units that are used in screen media (i.e. to be read on the computer screen). One pixel is equal to one dot on the computer screen (the smallest division of your screen’s resolution). Many web designers use pixel units in web documents in order to produce a pixel-perfect representation of their site as it is rendered in the browser. One problem with the pixel unit is that it does not scale upward for visually-impaired readers or downward to fit mobile devices.
3. Points (pt): Points are traditionally used in print media (anything that is to be printed on paper, etc.). One point is equal to 1/72 of an inch. Points are much like pixels, in that they are fixed-size units and cannot scale in size.
4. Percent (%): The percent unit is much like the “em” unit, save for a few fundamental differences. First and foremost, the current font-size is equal to 100% (i.e. 12pt = 100%). While using the percent unit, your text remains fully scalable for mobile devices and for accessibility.
